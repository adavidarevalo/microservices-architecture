# Terraform Microservices Infrastructure Best Practices

## IAM & Permissions
- Enforce **least privilege**: IAM roles must only include permissions strictly needed for their microserviceâ€™s function.
- Avoid using overly permissive AWS-managed policies; use custom-scoped policies instead.
- Ensure cross-account or CI/CD roles are clearly auditable and used instead of long-lived credentials.

## Module & Provider Structure
- All infrastructure components must be encapsulated in reusable Terraform modules.
- Modules should declare `required_providers` with version constraints, but provider configuration (credentials, region, etc.) must only exist in the root module.

## State & Secrets Management
- Use **remote state storage** with **encryption enabled** (e.g., S3 + DynamoDB remote state).
- Secrets must **never** be stored in plaintext in state files or Terraform variables.

## Tagging & Metadata
- All AWS resources must include these tags: `Name`, `Environment`, `Owner`, `CostCenter`.
- Tags should be defined via variable-driven defaults in modules for consistency.

## Networking & Security
- Security groups must be restrictive: no `0.0.0.0/0` exposure unless explicitly permitted with justification.
- Ensure IAM roles and policies are scoped to the minimum required actions and resources.

## Variables & Coding Quality
- All variables should have explicit types and, where meaningful, default values.
- Avoid hard-coded values; use variables or locals for configuration.
- Resources should be organized logically by microservice or functional domain.

## Automation & Auditing
- Terraform runs must be executed via **assumable roles** (e.g., via CI/CD) rather than long-lived access keys.
- Incorporate IAM Access Analyzer or AWS Config auditing in your workflow to track permission drift.
